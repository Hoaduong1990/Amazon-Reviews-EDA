So far I think I really like this, though it is a bit pricey. My skin seems a little drier than before, so I am working on finding the right moisturizer/smoothie to balance it all out. I do see a cleaner complexion!IMPORTANT NOTW: Be careful not to mix certain other skincare products or ingredients with it (no matter what the website may say!).To be helpful, I have made a list of things NOT to mix at the same time and important tips.However, to be sure, ask a professional dermatologist:‚Ä¢DO NOT MIX:-RETINOL should not be mixed with: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, AHA/BHA or Benzol Peroxide.-AHA/BHA should not be mixed with: Retinol, Vitamin C or Niacinamide (and possibly peptides but I am not 100% sure on that).-VITAMIN C should not be mixed with Retinol, AHA/BHA or Niacinamide.-VITAMIN E should not be mixed with Retinol.-NIACINAMIDE should not be mixed with AHA/BHA or Vitamin C-BENZOYL PEROXIDE should not be mixed with Retinol.NOTE: Both Retinol and AHA/BHA can be very helpful for various skin issues. While you should not MIX them, you can switch between them (example: Monday for Retinol, Tuesday for AHA/BHA, etc) nightly once your skin has been safely worked up to tolerating these more intense skin remedies. Do not try to do this all at once, right off the bat.‚Ä¢SUN AND CARE:-While the Drunk Elephant website doesn‚Äôt always address this, in most cases RETINOL and AHA/BHA should be used at night as they cause sensitivity to the sun that can damage skin. I don‚Äôt know if applying sunscreen will fully keep your skin safe (not to mention all the reapplying). While you *may* be able to use it if you‚Äôre staying indoors, do understand that harmful rays can enter the home, car and workplace through windows. If you‚Äôre going to experience sun, regardless of what you do or do not put on your skin, an SPF of at least 30 should be an everyday routine (with reapplying).As for if you stay indoors, away from windows, one would assume hanging out in a dark room all day would suffice, but I‚Äôm no expert.-So it‚Äôs beat to use Retinol and AHA/BHA at night and wash it off in the morning. A cream or serum containing Vitamin C thrives off sunlight, so that is best to use in the daytime.‚Ä¢IF YOU OVERDO THE SKIN TREATMENTS AND YOUR SKIN IS FEELING DRY OR IRRITATED: Take a break from the harsh products and use very gentle ones for a little bit. Particularly CERAMIDES. These are gentle and help your skin to heal, calm and moisturize your skin. I personally have used (and liked) ‚ÄúGood Cera Super Ceramide Emulsion (pH 5.5 / 7 free)‚Äù which is a nice, gentle moisturizer. There are also things like ceramide masks that can help.",True

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to age well so far (I‚Äôm 30), so I don‚Äôt really have any wrinkles, just barely there fine lines on my forehead. When I am using this, it basically disappears. My skin glows and looks really soft and smooth. I‚Äôm using it primarily as a preventative to delay significant aging.A few words of warning: if you haven‚Äôt used a strong retinol before, start with the 0.25 and work your way up to the 1.0 or your skin will dry out and react really badly. Also, the product starts as a lighter yellow and will darken after awhile, but it is still effective.",True
